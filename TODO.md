- All Time: Start from the system’s first recorded date (November 25) and use a 30-day forecasting trend.
- This Month: Use data from the start of the current month and apply a 30-day forecasting trend.
- Today and This Week: Apply a 7-day forecasting trend.
- Custom Range: Use a hybrid forecasting logic where the forecast duration adapts between 7 days and 30 days, depending on the selected start and end dates."**
