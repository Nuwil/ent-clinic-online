1. Slide 1: DATA ANALYTICS
Simple Explanation:
This slide introduces the topic of data analytics. Data analytics is the process of taking raw, unorganized data from a system and turning it into useful information that can help improve decisions and operations. In today’s world, including analytics in systems is not just an extra feature—it’s a standard expectation.

Key Insight / Takeaway:
Analytics helps make systems smarter by improving efficiency and user experience.

2. Slide 2: What Is Data Analytics?
Simple Explanation:
This slide defines data analytics as converting raw system data into meaningful insights. It explains that analytics is now essential in system development because it helps enhance system performance and the user’s interaction with the system.

Key Insight / Takeaway:
Analytics is a necessary part of modern applications—it turns data into actionable knowledge.

3. Slide 3: The 4 Key Types of Analytics
Note: This slide appears to be a placeholder or reference to types not detailed here. No content is provided to explain.

Simple Explanation:
This slide mentions that there are four key types of analytics, though they are not listed in the content. Typically, these include descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, each answering different questions about the data.

Key Insight / Takeaway:
Different types of analytics serve different purposes—from understanding what happened to predicting what will happen.

4. Slide 4: The Data Analytics Pipeline
Simple Explanation:
This slide shows the step-by-step process that data goes through in an analytics system. It starts with collecting data, storing it, cleaning it, analyzing it, visualizing it, and finally using it for reporting and decision-making. This pipeline transforms raw logs into useful insights.

Key Insight / Takeaway:
Following a structured pipeline ensures data is accurate, understandable, and actionable.

5. Slide 5: Why a Workflow Matters for Systems
Simple Explanation:
This slide gives real-world examples of how analytics workflows help different types of systems. For example, in a queueing system, analytics can track busy times and predict wait times. In inventory systems, it helps identify popular items and plan restocking. In booking systems, it optimizes scheduling by analyzing demand and no-shows.

Key Insight / Takeaway:
Analytics makes systems intelligent by providing data-driven insights for better management and planning.

6. Slide 6: Data Collection
Simple Explanation:
This slide explains how to gather raw data from various parts of a system. Methods include automatically logging user actions, using system triggers (like timestamps), integrating with external APIs (e.g., payment gateways), and collecting mobile app data through tools like Firebase Analytics.

Key Insight / Takeaway:
Effective data collection is the first step—without good data, analysis won’t be reliable.

7. Slide 7: Data Storage
Simple Explanation:
This slide discusses storing collected data in an organized way, typically in a database. It suggests creating clear, logical tables such as tbl_queue_logs or tbl_booking_history to keep data structured and accessible.

Key Insight / Takeaway:
Proper storage ensures data is safe, organized, and ready for analysis.

8. Slide 8: Data Cleaning
Simple Explanation:
This slide covers the process of preparing data for analysis by fixing errors. Common problems include duplicate entries, inconsistent formatting, missing values, and typos. Cleaning steps include removing duplicates, filling in missing data, standardizing text, and formatting dates/numbers correctly. Tools like Excel, Google Sheets, or Python (Pandas) can be used.

Key Insight / Takeaway:
Clean data leads to accurate and trustworthy analysis.

9. Slide 9: Data Analysis
Simple Explanation:
This slide introduces how to analyze cleaned data to find patterns and insights. Techniques include calculating basic statistics (like averages), grouping data (e.g., sales per day), analyzing trends over time, comparing different periods, and forecasting future demand. Tools like Excel (Pivot Tables) or Python’s Pandas library are commonly used.

Key Insight / Takeaway:
Analysis turns raw data into meaningful information that can guide decisions.

10. Slide 10: Data Visualization
Note: No specific charts or graphs are included in the provided content, but the slide title suggests it’s about presenting data visually.

Simple Explanation:
This slide would typically explain how to present analyzed data using charts, graphs, or dashboards so that insights are easy to understand at a glance. Visualization helps communicate trends, comparisons, and patterns clearly.

Key Insight / Takeaway:
Good visualization makes complex data simple and accessible for decision-makers.

11. Slide 11: Reporting & Decision Making
Simple Explanation:
This final slide explains how the entire analytics process supports reporting and decision-making. Once data is cleaned, analyzed, and visualized, it can be used to create reports that inform system improvements, strategy adjustments, and operational changes.

Key Insight / Takeaway:
The goal of analytics is to use data to make better, evidence-based decisions that improve the system.
